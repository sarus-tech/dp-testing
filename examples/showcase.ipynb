    "# A Practical Method for Testing Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "At sarus we build privacy safe analytics tools and one of our initiatives is an open source library called [Qrlew](https://qrlew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Qrlew is used to turn sql queries into privacy-safe ones under the framework of [Differential Privacy (DP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy). As the library was maturing and more features were added we needed to test that the results generated from DP rewritten queries were actually coherent with the theory. Thanks to this approach, we identified unexpected behavior in one of the mechanisms implemented in Qrlew. This discovery strengthens our confidence in the robustness of the privacy guarantees provided by Qrlew, as it highlights the effectiveness of our testing methodology in identifying and addressing potential issues. This motivated us to open source our testing methodology and tools to the developers and researchers community so, let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build trustworthy data analysis systems, it‚Äôs important to verify that differential privacy mechanisms truly provide the privacy guarantees they promise. While there have been other attempts to create open-source libraries for differential privacy testing‚Äîsuch as Google‚Äôs Differential Privacy [Stochastic Tester](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/blob/main/cc/testing/README.md), [DP Auditorium](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy/tree/main/python/dp_auditorium), and potentially others, our approach focuses on making it exceptionally easy to create datasets that resemble real-life scenarios and to effortlessly test them with any SQL query. In this ready-to-run Jupyter notebook on Google Colab, we introduce practical methods for testing differential privacy results. Adopting the perspective of an adversary attempting to breach privacy, we demonstrate how hypothesis testing can assess whether a mechanism effectively protects individual entries in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we also introduce the dp_tester repository that implements these testing techniques, showcasing how straightforward it is to apply them to your own differential privacy mechanisms. Through hands-on code examples and interactive experiments, you‚Äôll see how easy it is to empirically validate and verify the privacy properties of your implementations using our tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical approach bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world applications, empowering developers and researchers to ensure their differential privacy solutions are both robust and effective‚Äîall within a convenient and user-friendly Colab environment.\n",

    "## How to Test DP Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Privacy (DP) ensures that the output of a mechanism $‚Ñ≥$ does not significantly depend on whether any single individual is included or excluded from the dataset. Formally, a mechanism $‚Ñ≥$ is ($\\epsilon,\\delta$)-differentially private if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pr[‚Ñ≥(D_0) \\in S] \\leq e^{\\epsilon} \\Pr[‚Ñ≥(D_1) \\in S] + \\delta$$\n",
    "$\\forall \\; D_0$ and $D_1$, where $|D_0-D_1| \\leq 1$ (neighboring datasets differing by at most one individual), $\\forall S$. $\\epsilon$ is the privacy loss parameter, and $\\delta$ is a small failure probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adversary‚Äôs Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify if a mechanism truly satisfies differential privacy, consider an adversary trying to determine if a particular user‚Äôs data was included. The adversary faces two situations:\n",
    "- $D_0$: Dataset with the user included.\n",
    "- $D_1$: Dataset with the user excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversary‚Äôs goal is to distinguish which dataset produced the observed sql query result $r \\in ùì°$. We can treat this distinction as a hypothesis testing problem:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The output $r$ is generated from $‚Ñ≥(D_0)$.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): The output $r$ is generated from $‚Ñ≥(D_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyman%E2%80%93Pearson_lemma) is a fundamental result in statistical hypothesis testing that provides a method for constructing the most powerful test for distinguishing between two simple hypotheses and has applications across different domains such as in medicine, physics, economy etc. The Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma tells us that the most powerful test (one that best distinguishes $H_1$ from $H_0$) for a given error rate is based on the likelihood ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Lambda(r) = \\frac{\\rho(r | D_0)}{\\rho(r | D_1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho(r | D_0)$ and $\\rho(r | D_1)$ are the probability densities of $r$ under $H_0$ and $H_1$, respectively. If $\\Lambda(r) \\geq \\tau$ for some threshold $\\tau$, the test rejects $H_0$ (i.e., it guesses the dataset is $D_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining False Positives and False Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario:\n",
    "- A False Positive ($FP$) occurs if we reject $H_0$ when it is actually true. Under $H_0$, this happens when $\\Lambda(r)$ is above the threshold $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ FP_{\\tau} = \\Pr_{H_0}[\\Lambda(r) \\geq \\tau] $$\n",
    "- A False Negative ($FN$) occurs if we fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true. Under $H_1$, this means $\\Lambda(r)$ is below $\\tau$:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$ FN_{\\tau} = \\Pr_{H_1}[\\Lambda(r) < \\tau] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can equivalently express these quantities in terms of $S_{\\tau}$ defined as $S_{\\tau} = \\{ r \\in S : \\Lambda(r) < \\tau \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ FP_{\\tau} = 1 - \\Pr_{H_0}[r \\in S_{\\tau}], \\quad FN_{\\tau} = \\Pr_{H_1}[r \\in S_{\\tau}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the graph below there is a schematic representation of our $FP$ and $FN$ definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figure_fp-fn.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### From $FP$, $FN$ to an Empirical $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the definition of DP in terms of $FP_{\\tau}$ and $FN_{\\tau}$ where:\n",
    "- $\\Pr[‚Ñ≥(D_0) \\in S_{\\tau}] = 1 - FP_{\\tau}$\n",
    "- $\\Pr[‚Ñ≥(D_1) \\in S_{\\tau}] = FN_{\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and after re-arranging we have the expression: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - \\delta - FP_{\\tau}}{FN_{\\tau}}\\right)  \\quad \\quad \\forall \\; D_0, D_1, |D_0-D_1| \\leq 1, \\quad \\forall \\; S_{\\tau}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $FP_{\\tau}$ and $FN_{\\tau}$:\n",
    "We cannot compute  $FP_{\\tau}$  and  $FN_{\\tau}$  directly, as they require integrating the unknown continuous probability densities $\\rho(r \\mid D_0)$  and  $\\rho(r \\mid D_1)$. However, we can estimate them by approximating these integrals with sums over observed counts, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We partition the result space $ùì°$ into discrete subsets called buckets. Any result $r$ of an SQL query can be mapped to one and only one bucket $I_j$. Here, we introduce the bucket function $p : ùì° \\to \\mathbb{N}$, which maps each result $r \\in ùì°$ to the integer index $j$ of its corresponding bucket $I_j$. Formally: $p(r) = j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ if $r \\in I_j$. The reciprocal image $p^{-1}(j)$ establishes a bijection between query result sets and the integers they map to: $p^{-1}(j) = \\{r \\in \\mathcal{R} : p(r) = j\\}$, ensuring that each integer maps to a unique bucket of results and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, queries returning a single numerical value, the buckets $I_j$ can be disjoint intervals but they can also be: $I_1$: [-1 1], $I_2$: [-2 -1] U [1 2], $I_3$: [-3 -2] U [2 3], $I_4$: (-inf -3] U [3 inf) etc. As another more complex example, let's consider the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY gender.```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this query might be seen a mapping $r: G \\to \\mathbb{N}$, where $G = \\{\\text{male}, \\text{female}\\}$ represents the groups. The following is an example of legitimate partition of the results:\n",
    "- $I_1$: $g \\notin \\{\\text{male}, \\text{female}\\}$, invalid group,\n",
    "- $I_2$: $r(g) \\notin I_1 \\land r(\\text{male}) = \\emptyset \\cup r(\\text{female}) = \\emptyset$, results are not associated to bucket $I_1$ and one group is not represented,\n",
    "- $I_3$: $r(g) \\notin I_i, \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2\\} \\land r(\\text{male}) > 2*r(\\text{female})$, results are not associated to buckets $I_1$ and $I_2$ and there are 2 times more man,\n",
    "- $I_4$: $r(g) \\notin I_i, \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\land r(\\text{female}) > 2*r(\\text{male})$, results are not associated to buckets $I_1$, $I_2$ and $I_3$ and there are 2 times more female,\n",
    "- $I_5$: $r(g) \\notin I_i, \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\land r(\\text{male}) \\in [0, 10]$, results are not associated to buckets $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$ and $I_4$ and there are between 0 and 10 man,\n",
    "- $I_6$: $r(g) \\notin I_i, \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, all results that don't satisfy the conditions the other buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that within each bucket, the densities $\\rho(r \\mid D_0)$ and $\\rho(r \\mid D_1)$ are constant.\n",
    "Let  $c_j^{D_0}$  and  $c_j^{D_1}$  be the counts of $C$ experiments over $D_0$ and $D_1$ respectively falling into bucket $I_j$.\n",
    "The set $S_\\tau$, where the likelihood ratio is below the threshold $\\tau$, becomes: $S_\\tau = \\bigcup_{j \\in ùí©\\tau} I_j$ where: $ùí©\\tau = \\left\\{ j \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\hat{\\Lambda}_j < \\tau \\right\\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood ratio for bucket $I_j$ is estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\Lambda}_j = \\frac{c_j^{D_0}}{c_j^{D_1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose $\\tau$ to align with the edges of the bucket for convenience in order to identify buckets where the likelihood ratio is below $\\tau$.\n",
    "Under $H_0$, the probability of $r$ falling into the selected buckets is approximated using counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\Pr}_{H_0}[r \\in S\\tau] = \\sum_{j \\in ùí©_\\tau} \\frac{c_j^{D_0}}{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, under $H_1$ we have:\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\Pr}_{H_1}[r \\in S\\tau] = \\sum_{j \\in ùí©_\\tau} \\frac{c_j^{D_1}}{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The false positive and false negative rates are then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{FP}\\tau = 1 - \\widehat{\\Pr}_{H_0}[r \\in S_\\tau], \\quad \\widehat{FN}\\tau = 1 - \\widehat{\\Pr}_{H_1}[r \\in S_\\tau]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the law of large numbers, as the number of experiments increases (typically 10k‚Äì50k is sufficient), the estimates $\\widehat{FP}_\\tau$ and $\\widehat{FN}_\\tau$ will converge to  the expected values of $FP_\\tau$ and $FN_\\tau$, respectively, minimizing the estimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighbor datasets:\n",
    "We should consider all possible neighboring datasets; however, for practical reasons, we may select only a subset of pairs to test. This means that even if the test passes for the chosen pairs of neighboring datasets, it could still fail for other untested pairs.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `users`: it has 100 lines each related to a distinct user. The columns are `id: (int) UNIQUE` identifying the user and `income: (float)` is a random number drawn from $ùí©(\\mu=40000, \\sigma=10000)$\n",
    "- `transactions`: it has 10000 entries, The columns are `id: (int) UNIQUE` the transaction id, `user_id: (int)` the user who is making the transaction (it is one of the user in the `users` table), `spent: (float)` is a random number drawn from $U(a=5,b=500)$, `store_id: (int)` identifier of the store, there are 200 unique stores, `other_id: (int)` is the identifier of some arbitrary feature of the user, there are 10 possible unique other ids.\n",

Moreover, the user 0 likes to make transactions in all stores and he likes them differently: the higher the store_id the higher the frequency he visits the store to buy something. In other words, user 0 affects all the stores in different way. The other users don't have any particular preference among the stores so they pick them randomly. Lastly, imagine the `other_id` is associated to a characteristic of the user such as it's actual age for instance, thus to each user is associated only one `other_id`.\n",

    "#### Sorting Buckets by Likelihood Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the Neyman‚ÄìPearson lemma, we consider the empirical likelihood ratio $\\frac{c_j^{D_0}}{c_j^{D_1}}$. For simplicity, we sort buckets in descending order so those more indicative of $D_0$ (higher value) appear first, and those more indicative of $D_1$ (lower value) appear last:\n",

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated a practical method for testing differential privacy mechanisms using hypothesis testing. By leveraging the dp_testing library, we showed how to generate realistic datasets, apply differential privacy, and empirically evaluate the resulting privacy guarantees. This approach not only helped us detect and correct a flaw in one of our DP implementations, but it also provides a general framework that developers and researchers can use to ensure their differential privacy solutions are both robust and reliable.\n"
